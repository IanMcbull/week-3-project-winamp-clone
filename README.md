The original Winamp Main Window UI

Whilst I didn't manage to get a complete carbon copy of the original design, i was able to get a pretty close approximation of the original design as well as most of the functionality.

I try to limit the amount of time for each project to a week. This is to ensure that I don't get too bogged down in the details and to keep the project fun and interesting as well keep that deadline.

So for this project I tried to get a minimum viable product, instead of trying to create a full replica which would have taken a bit longer.
